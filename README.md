# Information Security with HelmetJS

# Boilerplate Infosec

This is an educational project built as part of the **Information Security and Quality Assurance** course by **freeCodeCamp**.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

Boilerplate-Infosec is a basic project designed to teach principles of information security and quality assurance. It serves as a starting point for developing secure applications using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.

A key focus of this project is **using HelmetJS** to enhance security by configuring HTTP headers properly.

Instructions for completing these lessons start at [freeCodeCamp - Information Security with HelmetJS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/).
